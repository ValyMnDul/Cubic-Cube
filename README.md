## Hackovina2025 Project-Cubic Cube  
  
**"Cubic Cube"** is a minimalist platformer game developed in Unity during the **Hackovina 2025** competition.  
You control a cube in a geometric universe, navigating through obstacles and precision-based challenges.   
The goal is to reach the end of each level to eliminate the **enemy**, using your spatial logic and quick reflexes.  
  
üîπ **Genre**: Platformer  
üîπ **Engine**: Unity  
üîπ **Platform**: PC

üîπ **Development Time**: 12 hours  

### **TECH:** 
- The game uses Unity's built-in physics for cube movement and interaction with the world (`Rigidbody 3D`, `BoxCollider`, etc.). Movement is physics-based, not purely mathematical.  
- The code is written modularly, meaning:  
  - Separate components on GameObjects  
  - Different classes for player control, obstacles, level management, etc.  
- Inputs are read directly using `Input.GetKey`, `Input.GetAxis`.  
- A `Canvas` with UI elements is used.  
- Cubes and objects are rendered with Unity‚Äôs standard materials (likely using the `Standard` or `Mobile/Diffuse` shader) for maximum performance.
